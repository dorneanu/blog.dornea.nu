      <p>I must admit &ldquo;<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness">Fooled by Randomness</a>&rdquo; was a hard to digest food for my brain. I had the same
feeling while I was reading <a href="https://brainfck.org/book/thinking-fast-and-slow"> Thinking: Fast and Slow</a>
by Daniel Kahneman. What do these books have in common? They both deal with human
behavior, probability, stochastics, heuristics. These are concepts for which humans don&rsquo;t
necessarily have a born ability to understand and to deal with.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb">Taleb</a> used to be a trader in the financial market before he got more into mathematics and
the science of economics. He spend some time analyzing traders performance and to which
degree randomness played a role whether chosen investing strategies turned out to be
successful or not. When someone is successful in his/her field we tend to attribute
certain skills and professionalism to that person, where in fact a success story was
rather just luck.</p>
<h2 id="skills-or-just-luck">Skills or just luck?</h2>
<p><em>Just to give an example</em>: Let&rsquo;s take 10.000 managers and let them play a game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each one has a 50% chance of making 10k EUR per year or lose 10k EUR</li>
<li>Those that lose the 10k EUR are gone forever (and will be labeled as <em>looser</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look how this could look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Year #1
<ul>
<li>Out of 10.000 managers, 5000 managers will <strong>survive</strong> and 5000 managers will lose their job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year #2
<ul>
<li>Out of 5000 managers, 2500 managers <strong>survive</strong> and 2500 lose their job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year #3
<ul>
<li>Out of 2500 managers, 1250 managers <strong>survive</strong> and 1250 lose their job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year #4
<ul>
<li>Out of 1250 managers, 625 managers <strong>survive</strong> and 625 lose their job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year #5
<ul>
<li>Out of 625 managers, 313 managers <strong>survive</strong> and 313 lose their job</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of the initial 10.000 managers, only 313 managed to survive and win 10k EUR per year.
Instead of say saying this group only survived purely out of luck, we tend to attribute
them &ldquo;high-level skills of fund managing&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="black-swans">Black swans</h2>
<p>When things go well, people use to say their decisions were the right ones. Especially
when dealing with future predictions (if certain events will take place, how economic
metrics will evolve) investors tend to <em>rely on empirical evidence</em> assuming that past
events might be a relevant sample of what the future will look like. This empirical
science is called induction and relates to the observations we make from which we then
conclude things. Also known as the black swan problem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">John Stuart Mill</a> put it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white,
but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do we learn from <em>black swans</em>? Always consider your choices and assumptions
<span class="underline">today</span> to be proved wrong some <span class="underline">other day</span>. Don&rsquo;t (completely) ignore the &ldquo;black
swan&rdquo; event as we can never be sure any theory is right. Things will evolve and
thus change.</p>
<p>How can one survive in today&rsquo;s &ldquo;attention dragging&rdquo; environment? How can we deal
with the information influx and constantly reassess our predictions and
assumptions? In our interaction with the outside world, our brain has developed
strategies how to make <em>quick</em> decisions when needed.
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
Daniel Kahneman distinguishes between System 1 and System 2 in
<a href="https://brainfck.org/book/thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>
</small></span>
We have developed <em>heuristics</em>, some sort of shortcuts which lead to <strong>biases</strong>. There
is <em>confirmation</em> bias, <em>attribution</em> bias, <em>hindsight</em> bias and <a href="https://brainfck.org/t/bias">lots more</a> . All these influence our perception and the way we think (as the
<a href="https://brainfck.org/book/factfulness">instincts</a> we develop as we rely on
<a href="https://brainfck.org/t/bias">biases</a>. We might always find patterns and explanations for past
events, but these are mostly useless for future events.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have this kind of events which you might consider <em>rare</em> to actually take
place. These <em>rare</em> events exist because they are <em>unexpected</em> and mostly because we cannot
have <strong>all</strong> information at our hands before taking a decision.
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
One of Stochastics main idea is that the more information we have, the more we can
predict a certain result/event. Also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law of large numbers</a>.
</small></span></p>
<h2 id="asymmetric-outcomes">Asymmetric outcomes</h2>
<p>Again, we have following example: Imagine you play a game where you have a 999/1000 chance
of <em>winning</em> 1 EUR and a 1/1000 chance of losing 10k EUR. Before playing the game, it&rsquo;s our
human behaviour to make decisions on things &ldquo;that are <strong>likely</strong> to happen&rdquo;. But in this case
this would be a mistake as the <strong>expected</strong> outcome is <em>negative</em> (probability is <strong>NOT</strong> expectation). Why? Let&rsquo;s do the math:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a 999/1000 = 0.999 chance of <em>winning</em> 1 EUR
<ul>
<li>The <strong>expectation</strong> is 0.999 * 1 EUR = 0.999 EUR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a 1/1000 = 0.0001 chance of <em>losing</em> 10k EUR
<ul>
<li>The <strong>expectation</strong> is 0.0001 * 10.000 EUR = -10 EUR</li>
<li>So each round you <strong>lose</strong> 10 EUR</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We sum up the <strong>expectations</strong> we have: -10 EUR + 0.999 EUR = -9.001 EUR.
So the expectation at this game is that you lose. Lots of money.</p>
<h2 id="probability-blindness">Probability blindness</h2>
<p>Multiple doctors were asked to read following test description and answer the
question. As you imagine, most of them failed to give the right answer.
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
This example is taken from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1445847">Randomness</a> (by Deborah Bennett): She refers to this
problem as the &ldquo;base-rate misconception&rdquo;
</small></span></p>
<ul>
<li>If a test to detect a disease whose prevalence is one in a thousand has a
false positive rate of 5%, what is the chance that a person found to have a
positive result actually has the disease, assuming you know nothing about the
person’s symptoms or signs?</li>
</ul>
<p>So 1 of 1000 people is affected by this disease. The test has a false positive
rate of 5%. If someone is tested and the result is positive, how likely is it
that this person is really <span class="underline">infected</span>? Most people would answer 95% (since the
test has a false positive rate of 5%). But this is wrong and mainly because it&rsquo;s
a <em>conditional probability</em>.</p>
<p>Here is the explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The disease affects 1 of 1000 people
<ul>
<li>This means that 999 persons are not infected and just 1 is affected</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assuming the test has no false negatives
<ul>
<li>Anyone who actually <em>has the disease gets a positive result</em></li>
<li>This means 1 out of 1000 tests are true positives</li>
<li>The <em>remaining</em> 999 should be negative results, but the 5% false positive rate means
<ul>
<li>5% * 999 ~= 50 Persons will receive a false positive result</li>
<li>per total we have 50 + 1 = 51 persons with a positive result</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, among the persons with a positive result, who likely is it that these persons are
also affected by the disease? To calculate this we need following (division):</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">number of affected persons /
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">number of positive test results (incl. false positive)
</span></span></code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>In this case this is <code>1 / 50</code> which is 2%! So there is a chance of only 2% to be really
affected by the disease.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of the book I&rsquo;ve felt like I need to give up reading because
I was somewhere lost between the termini from different areas. But I struggled through
the entire book and now I&rsquo;m happy I could at least extract some main points that sticked
to my mind.
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ESK5SaP-bc&amp;ab_channel=MarbleScience">Monte Carlo simulations</a> to be also quite interesting.
</small></span>
To summarize what I&rsquo;ve already mentioned in this post: We are all at some point fooled
by randomness but we don&rsquo;t give that much attention to it and often misinterpret outcomes
as something deterministic or related to whatsoever skills.</p>
