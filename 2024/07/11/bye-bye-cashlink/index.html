      <p>In the midst of the Corona pandemic back in 2021, I joined the team at <a href="https://cashlink.de/en/">Cashlink</a>, a company focused on <strong>tokenization</strong> and <strong>digital securities</strong>.

</small></span>
With little understanding of these concepts, I embarked on this new journey as a <em>Senior Security Engineer</em> within the TECH team. Promised a <em>greenfield</em> environment, I stepped into the unknown, excited yet uncertain about what I was expected to to.</p>

<p>As I look back on almost three years of knowledge sharing at Cashlink, I realize just how much I&rsquo;ve learned. Embracing one of Cashlink&rsquo;s core values, I consistently strived to <em>challenge the status quo</em>. Throughout this journey, I&rsquo;ve gained a deep understanding of what DevSecOps truly is about, with a particular focus on the <em>operational side</em>.</p>
<p>Having said this, I&rsquo;m looking forward to my newest challenge, where I&rsquo;ll switch focus to the <em>Dev</em> part in DevSecOps and delve deeper into <em>software engineering</em>, but still within the Security context. I also anticipate doing more coding, particularly in <em>Golang</em>, which kind of makes me happy. I remain grateful for all that I&rsquo;ve experienced and learned at Cashlink and hope to see you all soon again, whether in Frankfurt, Cluj, or Berlin!

  What I&rsquo;ve learned
  <a href="#what-i-ve-learned" class="heading-anchor" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
</h2>
<p>As I was implementing security in the greenfield area, I had the chance to strengthen my knowledge in specific areas but also deep-dive into new ones.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AWS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the first things I wanted to introduce was <strong>SSO</strong> which mainly included configuration of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/">AWS Identity Center</a> with an <em>external</em> Identity Provider (IdP). Later I was introducing <strong>SSO for SSH</strong> (using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html">AWS Session Manager</a>) which required employees to first do <em>authentication</em> against the <strong>IdP</strong> before SSHing into machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I had no clue about <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6262987">SAML based SSO</a> later on I&rsquo;ve also had the chance to implement several <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/oidc-conformant-authentication/oidc-adoption-sso">OIDC based</a> workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back at Scout24 I&rsquo;ve barely had to deal with IaC (Infrastructure as Code) where <strong>CDK</strong> was mainly used. At Cashlink I&rsquo;ve created my first <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/">CDK applications</a> for different setups. While being an convinced CDK is the way to go, I later on had the chance to learn <em>Terraform</em> which is my prefered IaC solution at the moment. Using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> I was able to quickly create PoCs and manage complex infrastructure setups
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
You can read about my latest Terraform based projects at <a href="https://defersec.com/">defersec.com</a>
</small></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personally, setting up the networking infrastrcture (several <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html">VPCs</a>, with several <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/">TGWs</a> in a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html">multi-account organization</a>) was the biggest challenge which taught me a lot about networking and what Network Security is about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IAM</strong> (as a <em>concept</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Especially within <em>distributed systems</em> proper and granular <strong>access management</strong> becomes of the most fundamental Security pillars</li>
<li><em>IAM</em> (Identity &amp; Access Management), when done properly, definitly can reduce the <em>blast radius</em> in case of a Security incident.</li>
<li>Besides <em>OIDC</em> and <em>SAML</em> I definitely learned how to setup IAM concepts which include <em>authentication</em> and <em>authorization</em> for different entities (people and machines, generally speaking) within an organization. Later on, while setting up the <strong>K8s</strong> cluster I&rsquo;ve learned about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html">IRSA</a> based authentication.
<span class="sidenote-number"><small class="sidenote">
AWS lately introduced <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html">EKS Pod Identities</a>.
</small></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>K8s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retrospectively, I wish I&rsquo;d have started learning about the concepts way earlier. While I was learning by implementing stuff, I didn&rsquo;t have a proper introduction which also explained the underlying technologies. Only a few weeks ago, I&rsquo;ve decided to take a more structured approach and purchased <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action">Kubernetes in Action</a> which I think is an excellent introduction with good practical examples.</li>
<li>Nevertheless I was fortunate enough to have some close insights into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">AWS EKS</a>, what it takes to <em>manage it</em>, how to deal with <em>secrets</em> and <em>configurations</em>. As I already was mentioning in in the IAM section understanding <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">Kubernets RBAC system</a> and how one can map AWS IAM to it, took a while (right <em>Aron</em>? 😎)</li>
<li>As I&rsquo;m reading more all the concepts suddenly make sense and I can finally grasp better how all the pieces work together. I will definitely create my own cluster soon (most probably using <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a>) for having a playground where I can safely play with <a href="https://helm.sh/">helm charts</a>, deploy applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Contract Security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smart contracts are at the heart of Cashlink&rsquo;s core business. Diving deep into smart contracts, especially using Solidity, was quite a challenge as a complete beginner.</li>
<li>Understanding all the potential attacks related to these contracts proved to be a challenging task as long as you don&rsquo;t have to deal with it on a daily basis. I hope that someday I&rsquo;ll have the time and resources to set up a playground where I can experiment with these technologies and simulate various smart contract attacks.</li>
