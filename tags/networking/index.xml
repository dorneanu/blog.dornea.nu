      <description>After reading this excellent article I&amp;rsquo;ve found this page. If you scroll down you&amp;rsquo;ll find the Apply section. Not that I wanted to apply for some job but I thought, it&amp;rsquo;d be challenging to find out the mail address:
 well, the email address is hidden below. Find the email and send your resume, solution walk-through and desired role.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the message:

      <description>Fuzzing is nowadays the attack technique used by a lot of pentesters and security researchers. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for vulnerabilities in media files (pictures, videos, audio stuff) or just binary files, fuzzing is the right approach if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do some static code analysis or debug the hell out of your targets.
When it comes to fuzzing there are a few tools to mention that have established during the last years.</description>

      <description>Backuping a whole bunch of photos and videos might be a difficult task. Taking care of the consistency of your backups is even more complicated task. Besides that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have your backups at a single place, thus mitigating the impact of a single point of data loss.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git-annex for some years but not like a pro user, rather than &amp;ldquo;it just works&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of ownCloud and I&amp;rsquo;ve liked it because one can access its data via web, mobile client or whatever.</description>

      <description>Doing a simple port forwarding is actually a simple task:
$ iptables -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080 This would redirect all traffic from 80 to 8080. But if you have some firewall activated, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to allow both ports:
$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ALLOW $ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ALLOW Otherwise the port forwarding won&amp;rsquo;t work. But this is not the use case you want to achieve.</description>

      <description>Continuing my admin series this time I&amp;rsquo;d like to setup a VPN using OpenVPN  as user-based VPN solution. Unlike IPSec solutions which require IPSec on both (server and client) sides, securing the VPN tunnel by OpenSSL is a more preferable option.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to show which steps have to be taken in order to:
 secure the communication channel use up-to-date (and secure!) TLS configurations prevent information leaks when the VPN tunnel is down  At least for the last one some additional steps are required to route your traffic only through the VPN tunnel.</description>

      <description>Continuing my CCNA journey I&amp;rsquo;d like to address inter VLAN switching in a more detailed way. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll configure my previous topology to use VTP and let STP prevent frame looping and other &amp;ldquo;anomalies&amp;rdquo; on Layer 2.

      <description>As a pseudo-preparation for my CCNA exam I wanted to sum up some of the basic configuration steps related to Cisco switches. Although I won&amp;rsquo;t handle every topic related to Layer 2, I will assume you have already some network knowledge. The main reason for this post is to show how to setup a really small network infrastructure and configure its components. For my purposes I have used Cisco&amp;rsquo;s Packet Tracer to simulate the network which I highly recommend.</description>

      <description>After started coding in C again I&amp;rsquo;ve had a look at some basic network stuff like: socket(), connect() etc. In order to resolve domain names, one was used to use gethostbyname(). I&amp;rsquo;ve used this function in all my previous C projects but this one seems to be out-dated as the main page states:
The gethostbyname*(), gethostbyaddr*(), herror(), and hstrerror() functions are obsolete. Applications should use getaddrinfo(3), getnameinfo(3), and gai_strerror(3) instead.  The really bad thing about gethostbyname is the fact that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6.</description>

      <description>During the past months I was from time to time reading all kind of stuff related to networking and security. During this process I came accross this book:

I found this book to be very comprehensive and very modern in sense of current topics across the &amp;ldquo;network universe&amp;rdquo;. If you ever wanted to get a more deep insight in how routers communicate with each other or how to setup a VoIP infrastructure, this book is a must.</description>

      <description>Well, where should I start? Looking back at my blog archives I&amp;rsquo;ve realized 2014 &amp;ldquo;year of the mobile apps&amp;rdquo; - at least for me. I was heavily involved in analyzing mobile applications: Android and iOS. For the first time in my whole infosec career path I was disassembling iOS applications and doing stuff (binary analysis) I was used to (some years ago). Besides doing a lot of mobile apps analysis, I was pretty much involved in structuring and hacking data.</description>

      <description>Proxying HTTP(s) traffic from Android devices through Burp should be actually no magic. Nevertheless you&amp;rsquo;ll have to take some important steps into consideration:
  Install Burps CA cert on the device
 I usually access Burp directly and download the cert file (cacert.crt) If Burp is listening on 192.168.1.1:8080, just go to http://192.168.1.1:8080/cert to download the cert Push this file to your device and install the certificate    Install ProxyDroid on Android</description>

$ dig telekom.de ... telekom.de. 86346 IN A 46.29.100.76 ... Now let&amp;rsquo;s find out the ASN:

      <description>Meanwhile I think I&amp;rsquo;ve felt in love with Androguard. I love its Pythonic way handling things and its visualizations features. As many of you have noticed, you can run Androguard inside a Docker container. I&amp;rsquo;ve never used Docker before so it was about time. You can find some general information about the installation process on Arch Linux at this address.

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll have a a closer look at DroidBox which provides a mobile sandbox to look at Android applications. In the previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with static code analysis. This time will start running our malicious application and look at the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; it generates. That would be:
 file system access network activity interaction with the operating system interaction with other applications etc.  DroidBox is very easy to use and consists of an own system image and kernel meant to log one applications activities.</description>

      <description>Recently a colleague of mine at nullsecurity.net released a new scanning tool called wnmap. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s a wrapper around nmap which helps automating the scanning process by using simple configuration files. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at it..
Configuration Make sure you you have downloaded the archive and open src/core/wnmap.conf in order to edit:
 the wnmap path editor preferences global parameters (to use in every scan)  Running the tool Now the obligatory -help message:</description>

      <description>I always knew DNS/ICMP traffic is mostly allowed and un-monitored. It was about time to setup some DNS server on my vServer which would allow me to break free! Thanks God there is iodine which allows you to route IP traffic over DNS.
I was recently at some cafe and thought it would be a great ideea to test my configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ve setup the iodine server a few weeks before.This is what I did:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you all using some VPN to keep your identity safe and private. Here&amp;rsquo;s some setup:
$ pptpsetup --create vpnde --server pptp.freedevpn.com --username free --password --encrypt $ pptpsetup --create vpnca --server freecavpn.com --username free --password --encrypt $ pptpsetup --create vpnl --server freenlvpn.com --username free --password --encrypt $ pptpsetup --create vpnuk --server freeukvpn.com --username free --password --encrypt For the passwords have a look at freenlvpn.com, freedevpn.com, freeukvpn.com, freecavpn.com. The VPN passwords changes every 12 hours, so keep in mind to change whenever the authentication failes.</description>

      <description>x11vnc allows you to connect to real X displays without creating any new X session (fluxbox, twm, gnome etc.). It allows you to control the mouse, keyboard and X events remotely. I usually use it when friends of mine need help and I want to see what exactly they&amp;rsquo;re doing.
Make sure any **ssh server **is running on remote-hostand you have a vnc client installed on your localhost. Also make sure remote-host has x11vnc otherwise this won&amp;rsquo;t make sense at all.</description>

      <description>Today I had the big opportunity to setup an OpenBSD based gateway. I&amp;rsquo;ve never used OpenBSD before and I was really excited about. All in one: Really clean (almost spartanic), secure 4.4BSD. Although I had some problems during the partitioning process - I didn&amp;rsquo;t thought they have such a l33t partitioning tool - the installation went smooth. Afterwards I&amp;rsquo;ve fetched the ports and installed some common utilities: No compilation errors etc.</description>

      <description>Although this is a quite minimalistic howto you should be able to do IP masquerading between your WLAN cards in less than 2 minutes. As I posted here I&amp;rsquo;d like to share use my WLAN cards to share one cards Internet connection with the other one. The following steps don&amp;rsquo;t apply only to wifi cards. The same commands should work on Ethernet cards too. Let&amp;rsquo;s start&amp;hellip;

      <description>Today I found a very interesting article about geoposition localisation based on MAC addresses. MAC addresses ? Yeah, right! As securiteam described here it is possible to find out your location using Google&amp;rsquo;s Location Services REST API. Further information can be found on Dinis Cruz blog. But where is all the data coming from? You may also have noticed Google&amp;rsquo;s Street View cars scanning your neighborhood for WLAN access points. Oh, I have forgotten about that: It wasn&amp;rsquo;t Google&amp;rsquo;s intention as stated here.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Secure your server using icmpKNOCK</title>
      <link>http://blog.dornea.nu/2010/10/03/howto-secure-your-server-using-icmpknock/</link>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you a short usage description of icmpKNOCK that was recently released. The main reason I wrote it was lack of security measurements on my boxes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want any sophisticated IDS tools nor complicated monitoring services. I wanted to implement something which will run on (almost) any platform without any external toolsb. Since the ping utility is available on most modern systems using ICMP packets to communicate with the server was the most reasonable approach.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the second main release of icmpKNOCK. I thought it was about time to release a new improved version. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly focused on the actions mechanism and tried to implement some flexible way of defining actions, adding key pattern and setting payloads. Besides that I have managed it to install a SVN service in order to provide the latest development version of my current projects.
The CHANGELOG for this version isn&amp;rsquo;t quite long.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;An increasing number of people are asking us about the recent paper coming out of Inria in France around Bittorrent and privacy attacks. This post tries to explain the attacks and what they imply. There are three pieces to the attack (or three separate attacks that build on each other, if you prefer).&amp;rdquo;
 The first attack is on people who configure their Bittorrent application to proxy their tracker traffic through Tor.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial you&amp;rsquo;ll get detailed information how to setup a fully functionable Debian Lenny system using virtualization software Xen. This entry was written due to high frustration caused by unreliable/outdated articles on the Internet and uncompleted tutorials. This here should be an attempt to describe the installation process completely and provide additional information which might help you solve common problems. The domU system we&amp;rsquo;d like to setup (in our case Debian) provides a neat netboot installer which supports Xen.</description>

The videos in this HowTo were taken on a NetBSD-5_STABLE/amd64 machine usingÂ Qemu 0.11.1. **Attention: **On my system I&amp;rsquo;ve used a patched version of Qemu as reported here. However you can use the fd= option to specify an open socket to be used. Example:
$ qemu -cdrom [iso file] -net nic -net tap,fd=3 3&amp;lt;&amp;gt;/dev/tap0 Using this example `tap0â€³ should be created before the qemu command.</description>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my impressions I made with Xen during the last weeks. I met Xen a few months ago but due to general lack of interest I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to give it a try.Para-virtualization - why bother at all? There were actually no significant reasons why I should use virtualization. But then it started with this thread, followed by this one. The really fascinating - and tough quite useful - aspect of virtualization consists of the hardware access policy which is implemented by the virtualization host.</description>

      <description>Any time you do some security researches you should better spoof/hide your identity. The best way to do that is to spoof/manipulate the MAC address of your interface. I normally do that when doing WiFi stuff: WEP cracking and such stuff. I usually assign some random MAC address to my interfaces to fully hide my identity.
A MAC address consists of six groups of hexadecimal digits. Each group is separated by hyphens or colons.</description>

The same applies to Internet surveillance: By daily traffic analysis you can find out who is talking to whom over a public network. This traffic allows others to track your click behaviour and interests. So if any mailicious guy has access to your network traffic (@work, @home â€¦) he will try to find more information about you, like e.</description>

      <description>Whats this about? If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with port knocking, you should know the basics and how this technique basically works. If don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, feel free to have a look at the Links section. Most port knocking tools are listening for TCP or UDP packets to arrive on specific ports in a specific order. icmpKNOCK is waiting for ICMP echo requests and checks their payloads. Packets that match given criteria trigger some action, e.</description>

      <description>Nowadays it is essential to backup your data and keep it safe in case of a data loss event. The most common way to backup (private) data is to use a remote server where you can upload your data. Certainly you want to keep it safe and private So how do you want to guarantee the privacy of the files stored? Upload it to the server and encrypt it afterwards?! Somehow you want to automate this backup process so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do nothing than running the backup script.</description>
