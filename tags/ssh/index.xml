  OpenSSH keys and the drunken bishop: Ever wondered about that visual fingerprint when generating SSH keys? Well this article brings some light on that.

      <title>VNC: Connect to current desktop session using x11vnc and ssh</title>

      <description>x11vnc allows you to connect to real X displays without creating any new X session (fluxbox, twm, gnome etc.). It allows you to control the mouse, keyboard and X events remotely. I usually use it when friends of mine need help and I want to see what exactly they&amp;rsquo;re doing.
Make sure any **ssh server **is running on remote-hostand you have a vnc client installed on your localhost. Also make sure remote-host has x11vnc otherwise this won&amp;rsquo;t make sense at all.</description>

      <description>Nowadays it seems like we&amp;rsquo;re loosing our privacy and are being taped by video cameras all over. The same applies to Internet surveillance: By daily traffic analysis you can find out who is talking to whom over a public network.
