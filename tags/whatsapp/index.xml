This is what I&amp;rsquo;ve received yesterday from some phone number I don&amp;rsquo;t really know. BTW: Which countrys prefix is that? The crazy thing about it: Every time I was sending a message to it, it responded with:
 Thank you. We have received your message.
 I had a look at the video sent and it seems to belong to some local club here in town. I was receiving some SPAM SMS from them but this time it was sth new.</description>
