      <description>Continuing with my tradition of quarterly book summaries, here are my reflections on the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read between October and December last year.
Biographies 📚 Elon Musk 👉 Elon Musk by Walter Isaacson
I must admit I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not a fan of Elon Musk and had some curiosity to learn more about the person behind the public façade. I wanted to learn more about all the aspects that shaped him and his mindset.</description>

      <description>As another year comes to an end, it&amp;rsquo;s time for my annual review (check out 2021, 2023) - a tradition where I reflect on the past twelve months, examining what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, how I&amp;rsquo;ve grown, and whether I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to stick to my goals. These reviews serve as a personal chronicle but also a way to share experiences that might resonate with others on similar journeys.
2024 has been a year of significant transitions and new beginnings.</description>

      <title>Mastering Golang Debugging in Emacs</title>

      <description>Introduction Since I&amp;rsquo;ve started developing in Golang I didn&amp;rsquo;t really use the debugger. Instead I was naively adding fmt.Print statements everywhere to validate my code 🙈. While print statements and logs might be also your first debugging instinct, they often fall short when dealing with large and complex code base, with sophisticated runtime behaviour and (of course!) complex concurrency issues that seem impossible to reproduce.

      <description>Keeping with the theme I&amp;rsquo;ve started a few months ago, here are my own book summaries for the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read between May and September this year.
Social Sciences and Psychology 📚 Lost Connections 👉 Lost Connections - Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari
After reading The Lonely Century last year, which opened my eyes to the increasing isolation in our lives, I was kind of motivated to read more on that topic.</description>

      <description>In the midst of the Corona pandemic back in 2021, I joined the team at Cashlink, a company focused on tokenization and digital securities. You can also check out their whitepaper and learn more here. With little understanding of these concepts, I embarked on this new journey as a Senior Security Engineer within the TECH team. Promised a greenfield environment, I stepped into the unknown, excited yet uncertain about what I was expected to to.</description>

      <description>Inspired by Eli Bendersky&amp;rsquo;s book reviews, here are my summaries for the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read between January and April 2024.
📚 Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don&amp;rsquo;t Know by Adam Grant
I&amp;rsquo;ve received this book shortly after reading The Scout Mindset where I learned about the soldier vs scout mindset where the later one can be shortly described in one quote:
“Your strength as a scout is in your ability… to think in shades of gray instead of black and white.</description>

      <title>From Doom to Vanilla Emacs</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2024/02/22/from-doom-to-vanilla-emacs/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2024/02/22/from-doom-to-vanilla-emacs/</guid>
      <description>Why vanilla? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the most obvious question: What&amp;rsquo;s wrong with Doom Emacs? Short answer: There is nothing wrong with Doom Emacs. I still use it and I still recommend it for beginners. Some years ago I started with Spacemacs and moved to Doom which, in my humble opinion, is far faster and more stable. So if you&amp;rsquo;re a novice and just entered the &amp;ldquo;church of Emacs&amp;rdquo; The &amp;ldquo;Church of Emacs&amp;rdquo; is a humorous reference to the strong advocacy and devotion some Emacs users have towards the Emacs text editor.</description>

      <description>I feel somewhat ashamed for not doing a review last year. However, this year I have set aside some time to reflect on the highlights of this year, what I have learned, the habits I have changed, and the habits I have stucked to. The following is my review for 2023, divided into several sections.
Books This year I&amp;rsquo;ve finally reactivated my Goodreads profile primarily for getting book recommendations. Although I have my own TODO list for reading, which continues to grow each year, I&amp;rsquo;m always curious to see what others have read addtionally after finishing one book.</description>

      <title>Documentation as Code for Cloud - C4 Model &amp; Structurizr</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/11/02/documentation-as-code-for-cloud-c4-model-structurizr/</link>

      <description>Introduction In the last post, I&amp;rsquo;ve used PlantUML to draw things like groups, accounts, and clusters. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on how different parts inside the business layer interact (usually components related to the main application/system relevant for your business). Now, we&amp;rsquo;ll use a DSL Domain-Specific Language specific for this use case to show these interactions between components, services, and systems. I&amp;rsquo;ll use the C4 model to show the same system in different ways based on who we&amp;rsquo;re showing it to.</description>

      <title>Emacs and the Cybernetic Productivity</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/09/21/emacs-and-the-cybernetic-productivity/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 22:03:10 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/09/21/emacs-and-the-cybernetic-productivity/</guid>
      <description>A few days ago I came across Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s episode on &amp;ldquo;The failure of Cybernetic Productivity &amp;quot; where he talked about a term I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard before: Cybernetic Productivity. This productivity concept has been prominent since the early 2000s and has served as an effective strategy for managing the growing workload, particularly among knowledge workers . Now, let&amp;rsquo;s delve into the principles:
Automate and speed up shallow task as much as possible Have software tools &amp;ldquo;speak&amp;rdquo; with other ones, send data from your browser to your Exceel sheet or to your editor (and vice versa) use as less clicks as possible automate all the things ™ Try to keep needed information at your finger tips make it easy to organize and get access to information the more we have the right information when we need it, the more effective knowledge workers we are going to be Example: Google You can search for all types of information In general knowledge management tools implement this principle that information should never be to far from the person who needs it Remove friction from communication communication has to be easy if friction is removed, high velocity communication / colaboration can be achieved Simplify the extraction of actionable wisdom from data the information we need to do things is often hidden in data we need tools that can find trends we need tools that can extract wisdom from data so we can have it at our finger tips According to Cal Newport this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t work because of the so called infinite buffer.</description>

      <title>Parse podcast transcripts using ChatGPT</title>

      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/08/28/parse-podcast-transcripts-using-chatgpt/</guid>
      <description>I regularly listen to the podcast Lage der Nation which offers transcripts to premium subscribers on their website plus.ladernation.org. To export quotes from a recent episode and add them to my private knowledge database, I followed these steps:
I activated the developer console in my browser. In the network tab of the console, I saw a GET request to a URL like https://plus.lagedernation.org/&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;/?podlove_transcript=json, which fetches the JSON version of the transcripts (provided by podlove).</description>

      <title>Documentation as Code for Cloud - PlantUML</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/07/30/documentation-as-code-for-cloud-plantuml/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/07/30/documentation-as-code-for-cloud-plantuml/</guid>
      <description>Basics I&amp;rsquo;ve become a huge fan of PlantUML even before I came across the concept of &amp;ldquo;documentation as code&amp;rdquo; I also code for presentations. So the term presentation as code is also a thing. and it instantly won me over with its capabilities. I have used it in many different roles (software engineer, security engineer, security architect) extensively to draw diagrams (components, sequences) and mind maps.
Though initially, the general syntax might seem a bit challenging to understand, I believe that with some dedication, the learning curve becomes quite manageable.</description>

      <description>Introduction As a Security Architect, my role encompasses reviewing existing architectures as well as designing brand new ones from scratch. The opportunity to apply Security principles during the design phase and develop an entirely new infrastructure with Security as the core focus is truly exceptional.
Designing a secure cloud architecture is not only vital for achieving scalability, reliability, and compliance with regulations. It allows businesses to optimize their cloud infrastructure while maintaining the highest levels of data security.</description>

      <description>The stage for the keynote Introduction During this year&amp;rsquo;s keynote, the main focus was on the velocity companies - and especially start-ups - need in order to bring their products to the market, highlighting the importance of agility. I was particularly surprised to learn that Flixbus is fully managing their infrastructure in AWS, showcasing the power and potential of cloud technologies. It&amp;rsquo;s impressive to see how Flixbus has invested in their tech stack, especially during the pandemic when travel was at an all-time low.</description>

      <description>Motivation Usually when I consume my daily news feeds, I prefer to keep context switching to a minimum. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a busy professional or just someone who values their time, you might want to streamline your online reading experience as much as possible. For me, this means sticking to Emacs and using tools like elfeed and pocket-reader to stay on top of my reading list.
Unfortunately, this approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with content served within comments at Hackernews or Reddit, where you usually have lots of comments and discussion threads.</description>

      <title>AWS Custom resources with Lambda and Golang</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2023/04/06/aws-custom-resources-with-lambda-and-golang/</link>

      <description>Motivation CDK is a great framework by AWS that allows you to define cloud infrastructure as code (IaC). You can use your favourite programming language such as TypeScript, Python, Java, Golang to define your resources. This feature is particularly convenient as it automates the generation of CloudFormation templates in a readable and more manageable way.
However, not every AWS resource can be mapped directly to a CloudFormation template using CDK. In my particular case I had to create secure SSM parameters from within CDK.</description>

      <description>I must admit &amp;ldquo;Fooled by Randomness&amp;rdquo; was a hard to digest food for my brain. I had the same feeling while I was reading Thinking: Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. What do these books have in common? They both deal with human behavior, probability, stochastics, heuristics. These are concepts for which humans don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have a born ability to understand and to deal with.

      <description>Imagine you&amp;rsquo;d ask an oracle (like the one in the Matrix movie) how much time left you have on this planet before the inevitable takes place - you die. Suppose she/he/it Who knows, maybe some day OpenAI will also answer these kind of questions will tell you at the age of 80 years your life will come to an end.
In my case this means I still have 80 - 34 = 46 years to go.</description>

Are you already suffering from Zoom fatigue and sick of meeting your colleagues in a virtual environment?

      <description>More than a year ago I started working on a side project born out of the furstration I had with buffer, ifttt and zapier. The use case was pretty simple: I just wanted to share an article and some comments about it on multiple social media platforms from a single location.
All sharing services had great functionalities (e.g. automated workflows) Initially I played with RSS and hugo for publishing content via a RSS feed which will then trigger posts on Twitter, LinkedIn &amp;amp; co.</description>

During this period I have done pentesting, code reviews, architecture reviews, software engineering, reverse engineering, consultancy, secure design and probably many other things I cannot remember anymore.

      <description>What do have clean, layered, hexagonal hexagonal, onion architecture and ports &amp;amp; adapters in common? They kind of share the same principles: Separation of concerns (business vs infrastructure code), data encapsulation (information hiding), low coupling, strict dependency flow (how layers should depend on other ones).
Still these concepts are not easy to digest unless you put them into practice. Furthermore architectural decisions are figured out based on personal, past experiences and the degree of knowledge people have when discussing viable solutions.</description>

In the 2nd part I will expand more how I&amp;rsquo;ve built the new brainfck.org using hugo, ox-hugo and org-roam. Extracting tiddlers from my Tiddlywiki setup was only the first step towards a Second Brain using org-roam. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a clear advocate for public digital gardens, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to keep my notes only for my self.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve writen about knowledge work and how its output cannot be measured in a linear manner. For knowledge workers information is their most valuable capital, yet everyone is desperately looking for a system to manage the continous influx of information pouring into their brains.
We spend a tremendous amount of time managing huge amounts of information and searching for the right piece of knowledge. At the same time we are supposed to work at high standards (fast and continously) and keep up with emerging technologies.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently stumbled over this wired article [1] where the benefits and drawbacks of having a 4-day work week were conclued from scientific research and &amp;ldquo;experiments&amp;rdquo; done in the field.
Seems like there is a momentum recently as more companies (but also governments) around the world explore the benefits of the 4-day work week:

      <description>In the first part of this series I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the main factors why I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move my digital garden / braindump / Zettelkasten to org-roam and which factors have facilitated this decision. In the 2nd part (still work in progress) I will expand more how I&amp;rsquo;ve built the new brainfck.org using hugo, ox-hugo and org-roam. Motivation I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Tiddlywiki for almost 10 years now and setup different instances for work, personal stuff and lately as my own personal knowledge management system.</description>

      <description>Summary Figure 1: &amp;ldquo;Building Microservices (2nd edition)&amp;rdquo; along my notes
During my overall IT carreer I came across different architectural design patterns where oppinions differ on the question if they&amp;rsquo;re the right ones for the problems/challanges teams are dealing with. Before reading this book I was familiar with some of the microservices concepts but it was some article (on modern architectures) that rouse my attention and introduced me to Sam Newman.</description>

      <description>Since my last post on reddit asking for some help regarding Emacs and TiddlyWikis REST API I gained some elisp knowledge I&amp;rsquo;d like to share. Maybe you want to go directly to the Emacs configuration. TiddlyWiki 5 For those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of TiddlyWiki yet:
TiddlyWiki is a personal wiki and a non-linear notebook for organising and sharing complex information. It is an open-source single page application wiki in the form of a single HTML file that includes CSS, JavaScript, and the content.</description>

      <description>In my last post I wrote about RSS/Atom and how these technologies can be used to declutter your digital life and reduce your exposure to the attention economy. Emacs (and all the amazing packages) taught me ORG mode, some basic Elisp and how to be a minimalist and use just one tool for almost everything.
Staying up-to-date with current technological trends, Security advisories, blog posts from smart people (and many other things) while not having to subscribe to every single newsletter, led me to elfeed:</description>

      <description>Digital Minimalism A few days after I have started working on this post, I begun reading Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s Digital Minimalism book and quickly realized how both topics interrelate to each other. But now one by one:
Digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your entire time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities to strongly support things you value and happily miss out everything else.</description>

      <description>Back in 2017 I remember people sitting together and doing pre-workout breathwork before some trainig session (Calisthenics). At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it was nor what it was good for. One year later I was introduced to Pranayama as part of my Yoga teacher training. Right after I&amp;rsquo;ve read Conscious Breathing but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really catch fire on the topic.
In 2020 I finally came across Wim Hof and realized this was exactly the type of heavy breathing people were exercising 3 years ago.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: Digital Minimalism: I&amp;rsquo;ve started with the audio book but then I ordered a physical copy for further reading.
It started with the audio book but soon I&amp;rsquo;ve realized there is so much valuable content in it I cannot extract by just seeking forward and backward. Finally I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered a physical copy so I can dedicate even more time digesting the content and putting everything into my personal Zettelkasten.</description>

      <description>Last year I&amp;rsquo;ve done some experiments with the Beamer LaTex class which you can use whenever you want to export an ORG document to a Beamer presentation. I&amp;rsquo;ve done some customizations and I&amp;rsquo;ve thought I have a quite decent presentation template. Till I&amp;rsquo;ve found this.
That reveal.js presentation completely my mind and I&amp;rsquo;ve started digging into asciidoc. And then there is also org-asciidoc which will export your ORG buffer into asciidoc.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve felt motivated to learn new things, deep-dive into unknown areas and finally change some things in my life. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you my most valued (software) tools, productivity tips, some books worth reading and finally some failure and success with regards to my habits.
Health Wim Hof Method Last year just before the (pandemic) winter blues was about to begin I&amp;rsquo;ve had enough of that feeling something you cannot control was already part of my daily life.</description>

      <description>I always use to say: &amp;ldquo;Software currently rules the world.&amp;rdquo; Almost every aspect in our (digital) life has to do with software: The apps you use on your smartphone, the mail/hosting services you rely on, online shopping, train tickets, in general everything that somehow adds value to your life. Competition among organizations is driven by speed, the ability to deliver new features to the customers, stable products, security within their eco-systems and many other aspects.</description>

      <description>Bye Bye Scout24! I guess it&amp;rsquo;s become a tradition to write bye bye posts whenever I switch jobs. So this happens again as I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to pursue new opportunities elsewhere. I feel sad but also excited at the same time. Working for 5 years for the same company (I do know that&amp;rsquo;s not thaaaat long) feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve spent half of my life there. Since 2016 many colleagues have left the company and new ones joined the Security team which I was part of.</description>

      <description>After finishing my last post on how to convert getpocket links to epub I was thinking a lot about my current workflow, how I manage to capture everything that might be interesting for me and save it for later use. Saving web articles for later reading is not a big deal but dealing with the amount of saved articles requires some management skills. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll share some best practices on how to organize and categorize your (web) articles in a GTD manner: Capture what has your attention, organize your content in buckets and keep an eye on your focus.</description>

      <description>Read, organize, archive I heavily use getpocket to collect articles and save them for later reading. While on my mobile devices I use the official app, on my desktop systems (mostly tmux + Emacs) I use pocket-reader.el quite heavily to collect/organize/archive my list of articles. After my transition from Spacemacs to Doom Emacs I still love evil mode and like to do most of the stuff in normal mode. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve added some keybindings to pocket-reader:</description>

      <description>Introduction With the recent success of Github actions you can automate lots of things whenever something in your repos changes, e.g. automatically generate static HTML content (using hugo) and push it to some repository for which GitHub Pages has been configured. Check this awesome actions list for more use cases.
Using encrypted secrets defined either per repository or organization, you can bring your Github workflow to the next level: Authenticate against APIs, login to different services while keeping your secrets/credentials away from your repositories.</description>

So what happened since then? Well not only in private some things have changed but also professionally I kind of switched sides. While being involved in pentests for a while I decided to become more blue-team oriented and help others to build secure products.</description>

      <description>These challenges were quite tricky since they didn&amp;rsquo;t focus only on the JavaScript language itself but also on all kind of stuff you can do with JavaScript: Crypto, obfuscation etc. I think they were a good opportunity to learn more about the language itself and get some ideas how JavaScript obfuscation techniques work.
Level 1: Client side validation is bad! Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the source code:

      <description>Fuzzing is nowadays the attack technique used by a lot of pentesters and security researchers. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking for vulnerabilities in media files (pictures, videos, audio stuff) or just binary files, fuzzing is the right approach if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do some static code analysis or debug the hell out of your targets.
When it comes to fuzzing there are a few tools to mention that have established during the last years.</description>

      <description>Backuping a whole bunch of photos and videos might be a difficult task. Taking care of the consistency of your backups is even more complicated task. Besides that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have your backups at a single place, thus mitigating the impact of a single point of data loss.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using git-annex for some years but not like a pro user, rather than &amp;ldquo;it just works&amp;rdquo;. Meanwhile I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of ownCloud and I&amp;rsquo;ve liked it because one can access its data via web, mobile client or whatever.</description>

      <description>Like always the obligatory introduction to the event:
&amp;ldquo;The digital age began 75 years ago in Berlin, when Konrad Zuse created the world’s first functioning computer, the Z3. Since then computers have changed the world, much like the steam engine and the car before them. The biggest changes in connection with digitalisation are still to come.&amp;rdquo; (http://science-match.tagesspiegel.de/the-digital-future)
Digital Future? Well, that sounded like a whole bunch of topics to be presented at the event: Big Data, communication, data analysis, digital society, future computing, gaming, mobility, networks, optimization, privacy, simulation, security, visualization.</description>

      <description>For the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve attended the AWS Summit in Berlin which against my expectations was very interesting. Not having much in common with AWS (at least not yet), from a security perspective the cloud still remains a very neglected threat to companies. As we all know there is some &amp;ldquo;rain&amp;rdquo; coming down from the cloud from time to time. And by &amp;ldquo;rain&amp;rdquo; I mean sensitive data which gets exposed due to misconfigured APIs, weak credentials or insecure applications.</description>

      <description>Having talked about hardening your server using chroot in a previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve felt that the whole process was way to complicated. I wanted to have a more generic solution regardless of the operating system (and especially the Linux distro). Besides that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite happy changing the systems systemd settings and do several modifications to the already running system. What I wanted to achieve was a closed, portable system of running applications inside a chroot environment.</description>

      <description>Nach mehr als 3 Jahren habe ich mich dazu entschloßen, VODKA zu verlassen. Angefangen bei Kabel Deutschland hat mich die Reise im Zuge einer Übernahme zu Vodafone geführt. Der Begriff VODKA selbst (VODafone + KAbel) bedeutete für mich nicht nur das Zusammenführen von zwei Mentalitäten (eigentlich sind es jetzt 3 wenn man Arcor dazu zählt) sondern auch eine gelungene Zusammenarbeit zwischen Rot (Vodafone) und Gelb (Kabel Deutschland). Als AppSec-Spezialist hatte ich das Vergnügen, verschiedene Kabel- als auch Vodafone-Produkte unter die Lupe zu nehmen und mit zur Unternehmssicherheit beizutragen.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not an Apple fan and I do have something against Apple&amp;rsquo;s closed platform approach. I also don&amp;rsquo;t obsessively admire Mr. Jobs and its products, but this book gives you a very good impression how it feeled to work with and for Steve Jobs. Although this is the only book I&amp;rsquo;ve read about him, I think Mr.</description>

      <description>Being involved in different projects where web technologies are used, I have to make sure that AppSec related security nightmares are avoided. One of those security nightmare - and in my own oppinion the most complicated one to explain to a non-sec person - is CSRF. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details since these are freely available. Furthermore I would like to focus on the countermeasures one would implement to prevent CSRF.</description>

      <description>Although I thought this would be an easy task, it turned out that chrooting daemons takes more than copying config files and libraries. There are donzens of tutorials out there how to do it, but the devil lies in detail - as always. Setting up a chroot environment is easy. But securing it properly is prone to faults which in worst case could let an attacker escape the chroot. And this is your worst nightmare, right?</description>

      <description>Continuing my admin series this time I&amp;rsquo;d like to setup a VPN using OpenVPN as user-based VPN solution. Unlike IPSec solutions which require IPSec on both (server and client) sides, securing the VPN tunnel by OpenSSL is a more preferable option.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to show which steps have to be taken in order to:
secure the communication channel use up-to-date (and secure!) TLS configurations prevent information leaks when the VPN tunnel is down At least for the last one some additional steps are required to route your traffic only through the VPN tunnel.</description>

Although I won&amp;rsquo;t handle every topic related to Layer 2, I will assume you have already some network knowledge. The main reason for this post is to show how to setup a really small network infrastructure and configure its components. For my purposes I have used Cisco&amp;rsquo;s Packet Tracer to simulate the network which I highly recommend.</description>

      <description>Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t done this before, I thought I could share some experiences with you. All this began during some APK analysis which was heavily using JNIs. In my particular case Java Native Interfaces were used to call functions inside libraries written in C/C++. At that time I was quite unfamiliar with JNIs and how they actually work. Besides that I haven&amp;rsquo;t debugged any native applications/libraries on Android before. So this was the perfect opportunity to have a closer look at Android NDK and its debugging features.</description>

      <description>When it comes to parallelism Python has some constraints which have to be taken into consideration before starting coding. I think the biggest one has to do with the Global Interpreter Lock which prevents several threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. Nevertheless you may want to apply concurrency patterns to you code in order to achieve more speed. Besides that you may want to use your cores properly otherwise you&amp;rsquo;ll end up like this:</description>

      <description>After started coding in C again I&amp;rsquo;ve had a look at some basic network stuff like: socket(), connect() etc. In order to resolve domain names, one was used to use gethostbyname(). I&amp;rsquo;ve used this function in all my previous C projects but this one seems to be out-dated as the main page states:
The gethostbyname*(), gethostbyaddr*(), herror(), and hstrerror() functions are obsolete. Applications should use getaddrinfo(3), getnameinfo(3), and gai_strerror(3) instead. The really bad thing about gethostbyname is the fact that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IPv6.</description>

      <description>After years of python hacking and all kind of projects (like netgrafio or smalisca) I wanted to do more low-level stuff and refresh my C/C++ skills. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to describe how it feels like coming back to C/C++ after 2 years of coding abstinence.
It&amp;rsquo;s low.. Very low Having started a new project I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten everything. It just felt strange to declare functions and use header files.</description>

      <description>From time to time we all seem to ignore the &amp;ldquo;voice of reason&amp;rdquo; and tend to unconsidered actions. This will be a short summary of what could go wrong when one is forced to quick reactions which will result in chaos.
All started with an iPad Air. I have jailbroken the device from the very first touch. That time iOS 7.x was installed and a jailbreak was available for that specific version (iOS 7.</description>

      <description>If you follow this blog, you might have noticed that I&amp;rsquo;m mainly interested in #infosec, #hacking and so on. The main reason for writing this post was to encourage people to look behind the plate and make their life more enjoyable (and still stay inside their comfort zone :). Ok, &amp;ldquo;WTF?&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re probably asking yourself. Let me first start with a more detailed motivation behind this writing.
Motivation Being involved in data analysis on a daily basis, I have to read and modify data in a quick and easy way.</description>

      <description>What should I say about this book? A lot has been said and this uppon reasonable grounds. This book is meant to give you an overview of the most important security topics related to Android. Not only you&amp;rsquo;ll get a lot of stuff about Android&amp;rsquo;s internals, you&amp;rsquo;ll also learn about exploits (and how they work) targeting the this platform. I think I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time (and also the full knowledge) to look at any specific detail this book covers.</description>

I found this book to be very comprehensive and very modern in sense of current topics across the &amp;ldquo;network universe&amp;rdquo;. If you ever wanted to get a more deep insight in how routers communicate with each other or how to setup a VoIP infrastructure, this book is a must.</description>

      <description>Well, where should I start? Looking back at my blog archives I&amp;rsquo;ve realized 2014 &amp;ldquo;year of the mobile apps&amp;rdquo; - at least for me. I was heavily involved in analyzing mobile applications: Android and iOS. For the first time in my whole infosec career path I was disassembling iOS applications and doing stuff (binary analysis) I was used to (some years ago). Besides doing a lot of mobile apps analysis, I was pretty much involved in structuring and hacking data.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Proxy Non-Proxy-Aware Android Applications through Burp</title>

      <description>Proxying HTTP(s) traffic from Android devices through Burp should be actually no magic. Nevertheless you&amp;rsquo;ll have to take some important steps into consideration:
Install Burps CA cert on the device
I usually access Burp directly and download the cert file (cacert.crt) If Burp is listening on 192.168.1.1:8080, just go to http://192.168.1.1:8080/cert to download the cert Push this file to your device and install the certificate Install ProxyDroid on Android
Set proxy setting globally or only for certain applications In theory that&amp;rsquo;s all!</description>

      <description>After writing the previous article I thought I should share some Blockdiag plugin for Pelican. You can also check out the pull request.
blockdiag It&amp;rsquo;s basically a graphviz like utility with its own language (similar to DOT). You can create:
block diagrams sequence diagrams activity diagrams network diagrams rack diagrams packet diagrams It can save you a lot of time and has a pretty simple syntax. You can always test your code online using blockdiag&amp;rsquo;s interactive shell.</description>

      <description>I really like keeping things simple. And I also like generating figures from code using Graphviz. And since there was no Graphviz plugin for pelican I wrote my own one.
Using liquid tags I wanted to get my graphviz code rendered and automatically included as a base64 encoded image in my HTML code. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a pull request but you can find a fork at dorneanu-pelican.
Basically the tags works as follows:</description>

      <description>In this short article I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain what are the main steps to analyze an iOS app. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve writen similar posts related to Android I thought I could devote some of spare time writing about the steps required to analyze iOS apps/binaries. But first of all let&amp;rsquo;s start with:
What&amp;rsquo;s an iOS app? In a nutshell here are the main characteristics:
Objective-C / C / C++ compiled (ARM) executable mostly encrypted using Apple&amp;rsquo;s Fairplay DRM it runs in a sandbox it&amp;rsquo;s installed by the user mobile apps come as an IPA file which is the counterpart to Android&amp;rsquo;s APK Now that you roughly know what an iOS app is let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the most common blackbox pentesting tools out there.</description>

      <description>Meanwhile I think I&amp;rsquo;ve felt in love with Androguard. I love its Pythonic way handling things and its visualizations features. As many of you have noticed, you can run Androguard inside a Docker container. I&amp;rsquo;ve never used Docker before so it was about time. You can find some general information about the installation process on Arch Linux at this address.

Every time I&amp;rsquo;m working with DataFrames I somehow miss the search feature: I&amp;rsquo;d like to search for certain patterns inside the columns and rows. I used to use JQuery DataTables for netgrafio. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any simple way to integrate it with IPython. Well it was easier than I thought.

      <description>I use Python on daily basis. I love IPython and use it as my main shell for every day tasks. So it was a matter of time until I got captivated by panda, scipy and numpy. I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered myself Python for Data Analysis in order to get more familiar with the mentioned libraries. Before that I used to semi-understand how their work and got used to that copy&amp;amp;paste mentality.
This book is not only about data analysis.</description>

The list is full of some random URLs related to your company and nobody knows about. You don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue who is responsible for them nor which applications (if any) are running behind them. Sounds like a cool task, ugh?
Well in today&amp;rsquo;s post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how I&amp;rsquo;ve managed it to minimize the process of analyzing each URL manually and saved me a lot of time automatizing things.</description>

In the previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with static code analysis. This time will start running our malicious application and look at the &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; it generates. That would be:
file system access network activity interaction with the operating system interaction with other applications etc. DroidBox is very easy to use and consists of an own system image and kernel meant to log one applications activities.</description>

      <description>During some Android malware analysis I came along some Java routines which were meant to decrypt/encrypt some content. Nothing special about it. The key had to be extracted from a file and the encrypted file was in Base64. After unsuccessfully trying openssl in order to decrypt the file I decided to make some further investigations.
In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll have a look how Python, Java and openssl (command line utility) implement Blowfish in CBC mode.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I&amp;rsquo;be migrated my whole blog from Wordpress to Octopress. Meanwhile I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Pelican which is the Pythonic alternative to Octopress. To be honest: The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m using Pelican instead of Octopress is the ability to import/include IPython notebooks.
After I&amp;rsquo;ve set up my blog using Octopress I only had a bunge of Markdown files. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started.

      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2014/06/02/googles-xss-game-solutions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are my steps how I&amp;rsquo;ve solved the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xss-game.appspot.com/&#34;&gt;XSS Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;level-1&#34;&gt;Level 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most obvious and easiest one. Just insert following code and you&amp;rsquo;re done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;level-2&#34;&gt;Level 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; won&amp;rsquo;t work you&amp;rsquo;ll have to think of another tags to trigger JavaScript code execution. The first thing which came in mind was to use &lt;code&gt;img&lt;/code&gt; tags along with the &lt;code&gt;onerror&lt;/code&gt; attributes. Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to share an idea I&amp;rsquo;ve had regarding pentest reports. Most of you surely have their own methods and tools to create nice looking reports after have done some pentesting. Since I try to keep things simple I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a rough idea how this could be done without Excel &amp;amp; Co.
Scenario Suppose you conduct a pentest and take notes during it. Afterwards you&amp;rsquo;ll be probably be copy&amp;amp;paste&amp;rsquo;integratedP the whole content into a layout or pre-defined document.</description>

      <description>In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to show some handy way to improve your process of documentating your project. Since we all know documentation is a must you might have wondered how to handle that without any big efforts. In fact it would be great if you could write your code along with the documentation and extract it later on for publishing.
Meet sphinx It is a tool that you&amp;rsquo;ll love! Being more technical:</description>

      <description>I was recently playing around with D3Â and discovered its dashboard posibilities. dashboarddude.comÂ has a nice compilation of really fancy dashboards (I was mainly interested in D3 but voila&amp;hellip; there are also other ways to do it).
Meanwhile I was remembered of old good IPython Notebook and its plotting features. This is what came out (You can find the code also on Github Gist: https://gist.github.com/dorneanu/9407737):

Configuration Make sure you you have downloaded the archive and open src/core/wnmap.conf in order to edit:

(Source: http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/ConsoleKit) udev is the device manager for the Linux kernel. Primarily, it manages device nodes in /dev and handles all user space actions when adding/removing devices. Also have a look at eudev a gentoo fork of udev.</description>

      <description>I really love Burp. Since I use it on a daily basis I thought there might be some way to automate it. Usually I mainly do these steps to scan some URL:
Define scope Start manual exploring OR spider the URL in order to get some target map Activate passive scanning Activate live scanning Wait to the scan to finish Have a look at the results Save/export the results Well these are a lot of steps which have to be done manually.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Split MP3s by silence detection using mp3splt</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2012/04/01/howto-split-mp3s-by-silence-detection-using-mp3splt/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2012/04/01/howto-split-mp3s-by-silence-detection-using-mp3splt/</guid>
      <description>This is probably the most useful command when it comes to splitting large mp3 files. You&amp;rsquo;ll need mp3splt (http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net) and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go:
1 mp3splt -s -p th=-40,min=6,rm Parameters explanation:
&#39;-s&amp;rsquo;: silence mode; activate silence detection &#39;-p&amp;rsquo;: specify arguments for the silence mode &#39;th=-40&amp;rsquo;: threshold level (dB) to be considered silence &#39;min=6&amp;rsquo;: minimum number of seconds to be considered as splitpoint &#39;rm&amp;rsquo;: remove silence from splitted files Be sure to have a look at the manpage.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Have a web performance boost with Nginx</title>
      <link>https://blog.dornea.nu/2012/01/26/howto-have-a-web-performance-boost-with-nginx/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.dornea.nu/2012/01/26/howto-have-a-web-performance-boost-with-nginx/</guid>
      <description>Why Nginx? Since I wanted to improve my sites load speed I thought I should look around for some lighttpd-alternatives which I have used for so many years. The really annoying thing about lighttpd is its configuration syntax. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive nor easy to learn. Besides that I wanted to have a configuration where memcahed plays a major role: Serve static content (html) from memcache. Lighttpd does have some modules/tutorials how to interact with memcached but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any working configuration.</description>

      <description>I thought this could be useful for other Namecheap customers. &#39;Namecheap&amp;rsquo;s Open-Xchange servers use only &#39;secure&amp;rsquo; connnections (STARTTLS, SSL/TLS). Supposing domain.com is the domain you have purchased, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to configure Thunderbird using these settings:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ; Username : your email address (@domain.com) ; Password : password you have set in the Namecheap configuration menu ; Incoming/outgoing servers : oxmail.</description>

      <description>Ich musste das veröffentlichen. Ich habe mir gestern einen abgelacht. Lest euch das selber durch:
Hallo liebe Studenten,
die Tage werden kürzer und auch kälter. Leider haben einige unserer Studenten anscheinend die unschöne Angewohnheit sich nur dann zu waschen, wenn sie merken, dass sie es nötig hätten. Im Gegensatz zu den heißen Sommertagen merkt man das persönlich im Winter natürlich weniger, was jedoch nicht bedeutet, dass es andere im Umfeld nicht bemerken - zum Beispiel durch den leicht beißenden Geruch in vollen Vorlesungs- oder Tutorienveranstaltungen.</description>

      <description>I always knew DNS/ICMP traffic is mostly allowed and un-monitored. It was about time to setup some DNS server on my vServer which would allow me to break free! Thanks God there is iodine which allows you to route IP traffic over DNS.
I was recently at some cafe and thought it would be a great ideea to test my configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ve setup the iodine server a few weeks before.This is what I did:</description>

      <description>I was recently doing some hacks and realized that there must be a way to store gained information in a secure manner. I usually encrypt sensitive information (like passwords, accounts etc.) using GPG. But that&amp;rsquo;s quite unhandy: You always need your private key and the encrypted data is stored unencrypted on the device (unless you&amp;rsquo;re using full disk encryption which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem since data is stored encrypted on the device).</description>

Initial situation I have some videos taken with my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10 in AVCHD Lite format (MTS). All I want to do is to convert these files into some more handy format like MKV (Matroska).
Demuxing I&amp;rsquo;ve used tsMuxeR from SmartLabs to demux the files. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I did:

      <description>x11vnc allows you to connect to real X displays without creating any new X session (fluxbox, twm, gnome etc.). It allows you to control the mouse, keyboard and X events remotely. I usually use it when friends of mine need help and I want to see what exactly they&amp;rsquo;re doing.
Make sure any **ssh server **is running on remote-hostand you have a vnc client installed on your localhost. Also make sure remote-host has x11vnc otherwise this won&amp;rsquo;t make sense at all.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all starts with virtualisation! Since there is no BSD at all on my laptop, I thought I should give the most important ones a chance: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. Although there were several rumours afloat – related to complexity factors (installation, configuration etc.) – I had absolutely no problem setting up *BSD with X11(!!!). Besides that I had a look at the packaging systems provided within each BSD. My conclusion: They are pretty much the same: &lt;strong&gt;make install&lt;/strong&gt; and basta. Here some screenshots:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No more NetBSD on my laptop (this has to do with several things, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about in a future post): I had to fall in love with Gentoo! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to give you some quick overview related to this posts title: Encryption under Gentoo using Luks.
There are serveral (good!) tutorials out there. Among these I&amp;rsquo;ve used:

      <description>Today I had the big opportunity to setup an OpenBSD based gateway. I&amp;rsquo;ve never used OpenBSD before and I was really excited about. All in one: Really clean (almost spartanic), secure 4.4BSD. Although I had some problems during the partitioning process - I didn&amp;rsquo;t thought they have such a l33t partitioning tool - the installation went smooth. Afterwards I&amp;rsquo;ve fetched the ports and installed some common utilities: No compilation errors etc.</description>

      <description>Suppose you were a Linux developer and you&amp;rsquo;re about to implement the well known system calls: malloc and free. How would you start? Which (already implemented) functions would you use? How would you organize your (free) memory? Which information would you like to have about certain memory regions? Those are the minimal problems you&amp;rsquo;re about to face with. What about memory fragmentation? Speaking of memory: How would you implement this thing called memory?</description>

As I posted here I&amp;rsquo;d like to share use my WLAN cards to share one cards Internet connection with the other one. The following steps don&amp;rsquo;t apply only to wifi cards. The same commands should work on Ethernet cards too. Let&amp;rsquo;s start&amp;hellip;

      <description>Today I found a very interesting article about geoposition localisation based on MAC addresses. MAC addresses ? Yeah, right! As securiteam described here it is possible to find out your location using Google&amp;rsquo;s Location Services REST API. Further information can be found on Dinis Cruz blog. But where is all the data coming from? You may also have noticed Google&amp;rsquo;s Street View cars scanning your neighborhood for WLAN access points. Oh, I have forgotten about that: It wasn&amp;rsquo;t Google&amp;rsquo;s intention as stated here.</description>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you a short usage description of icmpKNOCK that was recently released. The main reason I wrote it was lack of security measurements on my boxes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want any sophisticated IDS tools nor complicated monitoring services. I wanted to implement something which will run on (almost) any platform without any external toolsb. Since the ping utility is available on most modern systems using ICMP packets to communicate with the server was the most reasonable approach.</description>

What could this be? The word is that it is the last command Stuxnet is waiting for. The last command before what? Before the whole building explodes? Let&amp;rsquo;s come back to one&amp;rsquo;s senses.

      <description>Yepp.. It&amp;rsquo;s another one. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it on my own laptop and voila: BOOM! Anoher local root exploit is out there. In fact this exploit shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been released at all.. An earlier incident was reported in 2007.So why in God&amp;rsquo;s sake is this malfunction still in the wild? We don&amp;rsquo;t know it. I&amp;rsquo;d call it stupidity, if you&amp;rsquo;re fine with me. L33t hackers like Ac1db1tch3z seem to have antipathy against good security researchers like Ben Hawkes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the second main release of icmpKNOCK. I thought it was about time to release a new improved version. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly focused on the actions mechanism and tried to implement some flexible way of defining actions, adding key pattern and setting payloads. Besides that I have managed it to install a SVN service in order to provide the latest development version of my current projects.
The CHANGELOG for this version isn&amp;rsquo;t quite long.</description>

      <description>Ich habe mir die Mühe gemacht, in meinem Studium fÃ¼r ein bisschen Ordnung zu sorgen. Ab sofort sind die Vorlesungsmaterialien sowie die Aufgabenzettel (Lösungen) des letzten Semesters (Sommersemester 2010) online! Solltet ihr geheime Skripte und Aufgabensammlungen bei euch auf der Festplatte aufbewahren, schreibt mir ne Mail. Vielleicht einigen wir uns zu einem Deal und machen das ganze public.
Ich werde versuchen, den Stuff aus dem ersten Semester so schnell wie möglich nachzuliefern.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t really like bloated IDEs like Netbeans and Eclipse: Too much functionality, so you might get confused and frustrated. I rather use my one and only friend called vim: C, C++, Python, Assembler &amp;hellip; and now Java! What? Yes, it can be a pleasure to code Java in vim. Thanks to eclim your vim gets Eclipse functionality without starting/using Eclipse. In my opinion vim ist the best editor I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.</description>

      <description>In probability theory, the birthday problem, or birthday paradox pertains to the probability that in a set of randomly chosen people some pair of them will have the same birthday. In a group of at least 23 randomly chosen people, there is more than 50% probability that some pair of them will have the same birthday. Such a result is counter-intuitive to many.
For 57 or more people, the probability is more than 99%, and it reaches 100% when, ignoring leap-years, the number of people reaches 366 (by the pigeonhole principle).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;An increasing number of people are asking us about the recent paper coming out of Inria in France around Bittorrent and privacy attacks. This post tries to explain the attacks and what they imply. There are three pieces to the attack (or three separate attacks that build on each other, if you prefer).&amp;rdquo;
The first attack is on people who configure their Bittorrent application to proxy their tracker traffic through Tor.</description>

      <description>If you ever had in mind to rm -rf /: DON&amp;rsquo;T! Even for its funny aspect, it isn&amp;rsquo;t worth doing such a stupid thing. Well I did it..At least not intentionally. I remember I was going to remove some ordinary directory and then I must have misspelled the last argument (directory name). Luckily I was able to notice the tragedy and cancel the command by ^C. F\***! What should I now?</description>

      <description>In this tutorial you&amp;rsquo;ll get detailed information how to setup a fully functionable Debian Lenny system using virtualization software Xen. This entry was written due to high frustration caused by unreliable/outdated articles on the Internet and uncompleted tutorials. This here should be an attempt to describe the installation process completely and provide additional information which might help you solve common problems. The domU system we&amp;rsquo;d like to setup (in our case Debian) provides a neat netboot installer which supports Xen.</description>

This simple comparison applies to hacking, at least to that one that is used to be practiced in Russia. Even Mr. Kaspersky admits that most sophisticated attacks have their origin in his own country. Russian hacking attacks seem to be more professional, the malware design more complicated and technical.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;d like to give you some useful examples how to configure network when using Qemu as virtualization machine. The videos in this HowTo were taken on a NetBSD-5_STABLE/amd64 machine using Qemu 0.11.1. **Attention: **On my system I&amp;rsquo;ve used a patched version of Qemu as reported here. However you can use the fd= option to specify an open socket to be used. Example:
1 $ qemu -cdrom [iso file] -net nic -net tap,fd=3 3&amp;lt;&amp;gt;/dev/tap0 Using this example `tap0″ should be created before the qemu command.</description>

In their latest project some guys from Frauenhofer SIT (Security Test Lab) have managed to conduct a quite realistic attack against a Windows machine with BitLocker, the disk encryption functionality in most recent Windows versions. As stated here there is a video which demonstrates a proof-of-concept implementation of such an attack.</description>

      <description>In this article I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my impressions I made with Xen during the last weeks. I met Xen a few months ago but due to general lack of interest I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to give it a try.Para-virtualization - why bother at all? There were actually no significant reasons why I should use virtualization. But then it started with this thread, followed by this one. The really fascinating - and tough quite useful - aspect of virtualization consists of the hardware access policy which is implemented by the virtualization host.</description>

      <description>Any time you do some security researches you should better spoof/hide your identity. The best way to do that is to spoof/manipulate the MAC address of your interface. I normally do that when doing WiFi stuff: WEP cracking and such stuff. I usually assign some random MAC address to my interfaces to fully hide my identity.
A MAC address consists of six groups of hexadecimal digits. Each group is separated by hyphens or colons.</description>

      <description>Add Lightbox2 functionalities to WYSIWYG editor TinyMCE - who thought this would cost me about 6 hours of work? In fact that was the easiest part: I just followed the instructions on http://drupal.org/node/252153 and everything worked well! Before being able to do that, some upgrades were necessary. On http://drupal.org/project/tinymce I was told that the module was deprecated and replaced by the Wysiwyg API. So I had to remove the old TinyMCE module, install the new one and add at least one editor library as described on http://drupal.</description>

      <description>Due to NetBSD’s great packaging system, software gets updated very frequently. It is very important to have a clean and safe system running and no outdated packages on your system. They might be vulnerable to recently discovered bugs and affect your systems’s security and performance. After updating the package tree (see documentation), I usually update my whole system by running:
1 $ pkg_chk -su Actually there is nothing wrong about that.</description>

      <description>Nowadays it seems like we&amp;rsquo;re loosing our privacy and are being taped by video cameras all over. The same applies to Internet surveillance: By daily traffic analysis you can find out who is talking to whom over a public network. This traffic allows others to track your click behaviour and interests. So if any mailicious guy has access to your network traffic (@work, @home …) he will try to find more information about you, like e.</description>

If don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, feel free to have a look at the Links section. Most port knocking tools are listening for TCP or UDP packets to arrive on specific ports in a specific order. icmpKNOCK is waiting for ICMP echo requests and checks their payloads. Packets that match given criteria trigger some action, e.</description>

coWPAtty is designed to audit the pre-shared key (PSK) selection for WPA networks based on the TKIP protocol. - Joshua Wright.
Since I had problems installing/compiling cowpatty, I had to modify the Makefile and several include-lines in some files. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m using NetBSD/Amd64. Feel free to modify the files at your needs. Download here!
Edit: As stated here, there is a newer version, 4.3. I edited the Makefile and created a new tarball.</description>

      <description>Nowadays it is essential to backup your data and keep it safe in case of a data loss event. The most common way to backup (private) data is to use a remote server where you can upload your data. Certainly you want to keep it safe and private So how do you want to guarantee the privacy of the files stored? Upload it to the server and encrypt it afterwards?! Somehow you want to automate this backup process so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do nothing than running the backup script.</description>

I admit I had to refresh my knowledge about linux socket programming and go through some coding examples.</description>

      <description>Wozu denn die ganze Aufregung über das neue Feature von StudiVZ? Der Name mag ja einen total verwirren, hat aber nichts mit mittelafrikanischer Kommunikationskultur zu tun. Micro-Blogging nennt sich das Ganze und soll zum einen die User darüber informieren, was in ihrer Nähe (gemeint sind ihre Kontakte bei VZ) alles passiert (ist) und zum anderen ihnen die Möglichkeit bieten, ihre Freunde auf dem Laufenden zu Halten.

      <description>I just started installing NetBSD on my 2nd laptop. Everything works like a charm! (thanks L. for your support xD) I was kind of sick of Linux/Debian and wanted to try something new. I made my decision and installed NetBSD due to its high portability: &amp;ldquo;Of course it runs NetBSD!&amp;rdquo; I heard Thinkpads are very well supported by NetBSD but I need to accomodate to the new system and do some testings before installing it on my main working machine.</description>

      <description>Before you start reading this I&amp;rsquo;d recommand you to ask your best friend Google™ for the most common (platform independent) IDEs (Integrated Development Environment). If you want some top 10 of most featured/used/known/whatever IDEs go to Wikipedia and satisfy your needs. So don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: This article is NOT supposed to give you some comparison nor to influence your oppinion. I&amp;rsquo;ll just satisfy MY needs and give you some kind of reviews in using VIM for complex projects and daily coding tasks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding Python for almost one week. I really thank O&amp;rsquo;Reilly for their good quality and well structured books. If you ever plan to learn Python, just have a look at &amp;ldquo;Learning Python - 3rd Edition&amp;rdquo; by Mark Lutz. You&amp;rsquo;ll love it! And you&amp;rsquo;ll really get impressed and fascinated by Pythons vast functionalities like I did.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the big thing about Python? Well to be honest my answer is simply: Because it&amp;rsquo;s damn cool.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Get SETOF from Array in PostgreSQL</title>

      <description>The use of so called &amp;ldquo;procedural languages&amp;rdquo; in PostgreSQL allows the user to write user-defined functions in other languages than SQL or C. Since every query is sent to the server, the database server has to know how to interpret and handle function statements. As the PostgreSQL documentation describes, the function handler itself is a C language function compiled into a shared object and loaded on demand. All you have to do is to install the language into your database.</description>

      <description>Wow! So schnell kann die Zeit vergehen&amp;hellip;Vor ungefähr 5 Monaten wurde ein gewisser Victor D. in die Büroräume der Firma Golden Immobilien GmbH eingeladen. Grund dafür war ein anstehendes Vorstellungsgespräch. Damals wusste ich noch nicht, welche Herausforderungen mich im Laufe des Praktikums erwarten werden und welch Bereicherung meines Fachwissens noch bevorstand.
Aufgaben Die richtige Bezeichnung meiner Stelle lautete Datenbank-Entwickler. Zu meinen Aufgabenbereichen gehörte überwiegend die Entwicklung neuer (Datenbank)-Funktionen/Funktionalitäten für die Immobilien Suchmaschine immobilo.</description>

      <description>Einleitung Wir leben in einer Zeit, in der Dynamik sowie Flexibilität eine große Rolle spielen. Wir alle besitzen bestimmte Fähigkeiten, die in bestimmten Situationen zum Einsatz kommen können. Das heißt, der Mensch braucht diese nur zur richtigen Zeit „aufzurufen“. Genauso soll ein Kernel, das Herzstück eines Betriebssystems, auch funktionieren: Die aktuelle
Systemkonfiguration wird überprüft und Module werden hochgeladen. Damit werden dem Kernel Schnittstellen zur Verfügung gestellt, die zur Steuerung der Hardware etc.</description>

      <description>Einleitung Wir leben in einem digitalen Zeitalter, in dem sich Technologien rasch weiterentwickeln und deren Präsenz für uns Menschen eine immer größer werdende Rolle spielt. Gleichzeitig erfahren wir eine Zunahme der Computer-Kriminalität, geprägt von mafiösen Strukturen, die sich zum Ziel gesetzt haben, Informationen im Eigeninteresse zu sammeln.
Die Wichtigkeit dieser Informationen variiert je nach Art des Angriffs und reicht von der IP-Adresse des Nutzers bis zur Kreditkarten- oder Versicherungsnummer. Die dabei verwendeten</description>
