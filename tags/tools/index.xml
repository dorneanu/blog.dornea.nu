      <title>HowTo: Automate nmap scanning</title>

      <description>Recently a colleague of mine at nullsecurity.net released a new scanning tool called wnmap. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s a wrapper around nmap which helps automating the scanning process by using simple configuration files. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at it..
Configuration Make sure you you have downloaded the archive and open src/core/wnmap.conf in order to edit:
 the wnmap path editor preferences global parameters (to use in every scan)  Running the tool Now the obligatory -help message:</description>

      <description>A binary analysis, count me if you can:Really impressive skills! See how cracking can be a lot of fun! AttackVector Linux:Combine BackTrack/Kali, TOR and Tails for high anonymity. I liked that one: *Nmap can&#39;t UDP via Tor* Skype Big Brother Microsoft is watching you:You should take that into consideration before having your next Skype session. Writing a XSS Worm: Really nice one! Hackersh 0.2 released:You should definitely give it a try!</description>

      <title>HowTo: Split MP3s by silence detection using mp3splt</title>
      <link>http://blog.dornea.nu/2012/04/01/howto-split-mp3s-by-silence-detection-using-mp3splt/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.dornea.nu/2012/04/01/howto-split-mp3s-by-silence-detection-using-mp3splt/</guid>
      <description>This is probably the most useful command when it comes to splitting large mp3 files. You&amp;rsquo;ll need mp3splt (http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net) and you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go:
mp3splt -s -p th=-40,min=6,rm Parameters explanation:
 &#39;-s&#39;: silence mode; activate silence detection &#39;-p&#39;: specify arguments for the silence mode &#39;th=-40&#39;: threshold level (dB) to be considered silence &#39;min=6&#39;: minimum number of seconds to be considered as splitpoint &#39;rm&#39;: remove silence from splitted files  Be sure to have a look at the manpage.</description>

      <description>I always knew DNS/ICMP traffic is mostly allowed and un-monitored. It was about time to setup some DNS server on my vServer which would allow me to break free! Thanks God there is iodine which allows you to route IP traffic over DNS.
I was recently at some cafe and thought it would be a great ideea to test my configuration. I&amp;rsquo;ve setup the iodine server a few weeks before.This is what I did:</description>

      <title>HowTo: Convert MTS to MKV using tsMuxeR and ffmpeg</title>

      <description>Since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find any acceptable Howto, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write my own one.
Initial situation I have some videos taken with my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10 in AVCHD Lite format (MTS). All I want to do is to convert these files into some more handy format like MKV (Matroska).
Demuxing I&amp;rsquo;ve used tsMuxeR from SmartLabs to demux the files. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I did:
Now you should have following files on your disk:</description>

      <title>Simple MAC address generator</title>

      <description>Any time you do some security researches you should better spoof/hide your identity. The best way to do that is to spoof/manipulate the MAC address of your interface. I normally do that when doing WiFi stuff: WEP cracking and such stuff. I usually assign some random MAC address to my interfaces to fully hide my identity.
A MAC address consists of six groups of hexadecimal digits. Each group is separated by hyphens or colons.</description>

      <description>Nowadays it seems like we&amp;rsquo;re loosing our privacy and are being taped by video cameras all over. The same applies to Internet surveillance: By daily traffic analysis you can find out who is talking to whom over a public network. This traffic allows others to track your click behaviour and interests. So if any mailicious guy has access to your network traffic (@work, @home â€¦) he will try to find more information about you, like e.</description>

      <description>Whats this about? If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with port knocking, you should know the basics and how this technique basically works. If don&amp;rsquo;t have a clue what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, feel free to have a look at the Links section. Most port knocking tools are listening for TCP or UDP packets to arrive on specific ports in a specific order. icmpKNOCK is waiting for ICMP echo requests and checks their payloads. Packets that match given criteria trigger some action, e.</description>

      <title>CoWPAtty 4.2 for NetBSD</title>
      <link>http://blog.dornea.nu/2009/07/22/cowpatty-4.2-for-netbsd/</link>

      <description>From http://wirelessdefence.org/Contents/coWPAttyMain.htm:
 coWPAtty is designed to audit the pre-shared key (PSK) selection for WPA networks based on the TKIP protocol. - Joshua Wright.
 Since I had problems installing/compiling cowpatty, I had to modify the Makefile and several include-lines in some files. Currently I&amp;rsquo;m using NetBSD/Amd64. Feel free to modify the files at your needs. Download here!
Edit: As stated here, there is a newer version, 4.3. I edited the Makefile and created a new tarball.</description>

      <description>Nowadays it is essential to backup your data and keep it safe in case of a data loss event. The most common way to backup (private) data is to use a remote server where you can upload your data. Certainly you want to keep it safe and private So how do you want to guarantee the privacy of the files stored? Upload it to the server and encrypt it afterwards?! Somehow you want to automate this backup process so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do nothing than running the backup script.</description>
