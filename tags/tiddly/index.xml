      <description>Almost 6 years ago I was blogging about organizing and visualizing knowledge. At that time I was just playing around with Tiddlywiki and using it to collect notes during my CCNA course. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t anticipate to which extent personal knowledge management systems would become famous and trendy. And people nowadays don&amp;rsquo;t blog anymore: They take care of their digital gardens. While most of them seem to be just a collection of random notes, there are actually good ones where you can actually read through the thoughts/notes and learn something new.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been recently looking for some new ways organizing my notes/thoughts/tasks/bookmarks/whatever in order to keep things clean and backup valuable information. After spending some time reading others efforts to do that, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that mine were not that bad. Let me give you some overview how I keep track of bits of information and which tools are best suited for every day tasks.
Mind maps I&amp;rsquo;ve repeated this one several times: I like visualizing information.</description>
