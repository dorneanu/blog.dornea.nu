I wanted to have a more generic solution regardless of the operating system (and especially the Linux distro). Besides that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite happy changing the systems systemd settings and do several modifications to the already running system. What I wanted to achieve was a closed, portable system of running applications inside a chroot environment.</description></item><item><title>HowTo: Put nginx and PHP to jail in Debian 8</title><link>http://blog.dornea.nu/2016/01/15/howto-put-nginx-and-php-to-jail-in-debian-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.dornea.nu/2016/01/15/howto-put-nginx-and-php-to-jail-in-debian-8/</guid><description>Although I thought this would be an easy task, it turned out that chrooting daemons takes more than copying config files and libraries. There are donzens of tutorials out there how to do it, but the devil lies in detail - as always. Setting up a chroot environment is easy. But securing it properly is prone to faults which in worst case could let an attacker escape the chroot. And this is your worst nightmare, right?</description></item></channel></rss>
