I usually encrypt sensitive information (like passwords, accounts etc.) using GPG. But that&amp;rsquo;s quite unhandy: You always need your private key and the encrypted data is stored unencrypted on the device (unless you&amp;rsquo;re using full disk encryption which shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem since data is stored encrypted on the device).</description></item><item><title>HowTo: Get SETOF from Array in PostgreSQL</title><link>http://blog.dornea.nu/2009/03/30/howto-get-setof-from-array-in-postgresql/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://blog.dornea.nu/2009/03/30/howto-get-setof-from-array-in-postgresql/</guid><description>The use of so called &amp;ldquo;procedural languages&amp;rdquo; in PostgreSQL allows the user to write user-defined functions in other languages than SQL or C. Since every query is sent to the server, the database server has to know how to interpret and handle function statements. As the PostgreSQL documentation describes, the function handler itself is a C language function compiled into a shared object and loaded on demand. All you have to do is to install the language into your database.</description></item></channel></rss>
